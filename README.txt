This code is based on the paper titled "Extended Discriminative Random Walk: A Hypergraph Approach to Multi-View Multi-Relational Transductive Learning", which is to appear in IJCAI 2015.
EDRW.m is the file to be used to run the code. It contains comments about the procedure to be followed and the input and output types.
We have provided TwitterOlympics dataset along with the code in order to be able to run it. The code can be run on any other dataset provided the inputs are given in the format specified.
synthetic_dataset_generation.m can be used to generate the synthetic graphs and hypergraphs for running EDRW. The PDF synthetic_dataset_generation.pdf explains the logic behind the generation.
